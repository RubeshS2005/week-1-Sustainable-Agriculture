🌱 AI-Powered Plant Disease Detection
📌 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of my Edunet Foundation Internship (AICTE) under the theme Sustainable Agriculture.
The aim is to build an AI-powered system that detects plant diseases from leaf images using computer vision techniques. By enabling early detection, farmers can minimize crop loss, reduce excessive pesticide use, and adopt sustainable farming practices.

🎯 Objectives

- Apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) in agriculture for disease identification
- Train a deep learning model using plant leaf images
- Provide a simple tool (Colab/Streamlit) for users to upload an image and receive predictions
- Promote sustainability by reducing waste, cost, and chemical overuse

📂 Dataset

- Source: Kaggle – New Plant Diseases Dataset
- Size: ~3 GB
- Classes: Multiple crop species (healthy + diseased leaves)
- Preprocessing: Resizing, normalization, and data augmentation for robustness

⚙️ Tech Stack

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries/Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, OpenCV, scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- Platform: Google Colab
- Deployment (Optional): Streamlit / FlaskFlask for interactive demo

🛠️ Workflow

- Data Preprocessing: Load dataset, resize, normalize, augment
- Model Development: Transfer Learning (MobileNet, ResNet, EfficientNet), train & validate
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, confusion matrix
- Deployment: Streamlit demo for predictions

📊 Results (Expected)

- Early detection reduces major crop losses
- Minimizes pesticide use, eco-friendly farming
- Supports farmers in improving yield & income
- Encourages AI-driven solutions for long-term sustainability
